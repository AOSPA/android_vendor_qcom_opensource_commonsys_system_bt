      "message": "Not yet, but would be surprised if it works. I\u0027m still looking for a way to replace these libs and apps in stock rom as my main phone isn\u0027t supported by PA (yet? maybe qssi will work, but I have no idea how to build it, probably lot\u0027s of features will be missing from stock rom as well). Just using Bluetooth.apk from PA build didn\u0027t work because selinux_android_setcontext(1002, 0, \"default:privapp:targetSdkVersion\u003d33:complete\", \"com.android.bluetooth\") failed. \nShould we drop lhdc ext api functions? They seem to be for some kind of spatial audio and metadata, can\u0027t see how that will work in PA.\nAlso not sure what framework/api/current.txt is used for.",

      "message": "Red Magic 8 Pro. Tag seems to be LA.QSSI.13.0.r1-07500-qssi.0-1 (at least for 3.19, now I\u0027m on 3.28, so it was probably updated to something like LA.QSSI.13.0.r1-09800-qssi.0 based on release date), not sure if it\u0027s going to be compatible or not. Replacing libbluetooth_qti_jni.so didn\u0027t work because of missing bt_adv_audio (so JNI failed to find nececcary methods) and replacing apk will crash because of that selinux stuff.\nJust replacing libbluetooth_qti.so didn\u0027t work also and I have no idea why exactly (logs: https://pastebin.com/JqXP8Bqp), seems to be something with BLE (BLE_START_TIMEOUT). Any ideas? Or this is once again bt_adv_audio issue?\nSo current.txt is not used anywhere in the build process?",

Can I help you build a qssi or a ROM for your device?\n\ncurrent.txt is similar to frameworks/base, it is a compile time check for APIs to match the stable API.  In framework, generally, you want to @hide new public methods so you don\u0027t change the API.  In Bluetooth, if it compiles, we\u0027re probably fine.",
